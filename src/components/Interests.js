        <p>
          Outside of my professional work, I have a wide range of interests and hobbies that keep me active and engaged.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Sports and Fitness</h2>
      <p>
        I am passionate about sports, particularly basketball and soccer. I have played both sports since my school days and continue to enjoy them in my spare time. I recently picked up table tennis as well.
        Additionally, I love going to the gym regularly to stay fit and healthy.
      </p>

      <h2>Technology and Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Besides my professional work, I enjoy coding in my spare time to build my skills and work on personal projects. I am always exploring new technologies and frameworks to keep my knowledge up-to-date.
      </p>

      <h2>Travel and Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Traveling is another passion of mine. I love exploring new places and cultures, and I have been fortunate enough to visit several interesting locations. My favorite travel destination so far has been St. Martin.
      </p>

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        I have a special love for all genres of music, and my preferences depend on my mood. Whether it's relaxing to some jazz or getting pumped up with some rock, music plays a significant role in my life.
      </p>

      <h2>Family Time</h2>
      <p>
        Spending time with my family is very important to me. I have two young children, and I cherish every moment I get to spend with them. Watching them grow and learn new things is a joy.
      </p>

      <h2>Life Philosophy and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My personal and professional goals for the next 5-10 years include starting a software solutions business and becoming an entrepreneur. I believe in the philosophy that you never stop learning; each new day presents a new opportunity. To stay motivated and focused, I always challenge myself.
